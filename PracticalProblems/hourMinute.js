Given a time in the hh:mm format, return the angle (to the closest whole degree) 
between the hour and the minute hands.

As a follow-up, find all the times when the angle between both hands is 0.

Example(s)
calcluateAngle(12:00) returns 0
calcluateAngle(12:30) returns 165
calcluateAngle(12:31) returns 171
calcluateAngle(11:59) returns 6
 

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
15 seconds from the top is 45deg therefore every 5 seconds is 15 degrees
take into consideration that the H hand moves gradually so at 1230 it's half way between 12 and 1
 
Each minute the clock moves 6 degrees (got this by doing 90/15)
at half way the hour hand is half way (ie. 12:30) the hand would be half way between 12 and 1
based on that at quarterway the hand would be quarter way

console.log(calculateAngle('12:00')) // returns 0

console.log(calculateAngle('12:31')) // returns 171
console.log(calculateAngle('11:59')) // returns
console.log(calculateAngle("1:42") == 159)
console.log(calculateAngle("3:30") == 75)
